# University System

This project was created using Python, and using the Tkinter library, and including a database with MySQL, 
and by including the OOP concepts and the Software Engineering concepts, and the most important thing about this particular project is 
the Software Engineering concepts I used and devloped and the workflow i followed from analysis, design, implementation and testing, and here is some 
of the design models I used:

First of all the use case diagram for the project which describes the stakeholders of the sytem and each action for each user, and the common 
actions between them:

and then the Log in activity diagram, which describes the workflow of the log in action for each actor and what happens in a scucessful log in, and 
what choices the actor can pick:

and then the first choice which is the Gpa Calculator, which is the biggest one in context of functionality in this project, and it's based on my university material,
and the GPA system for the university, and that you can send the calculated GPA usnig your number or save the details to your device, and the activity diagram is as 
follow:

and the second choice is the Material Details, which is a simple in the interface side, and it contains the material of the computer science faculty in my university,
and the plans you could follow if you want to finish in 3 and half years or in 4 years, and then the search bar, where you could enter any material code for CS, and
it will return a window with the details about that material and when to take and how to study it and a link for some exams you could solve, and here is the activity 
diagram:
